## üìÅ Dataset Explanation

There are 2 datasets used in this repository namely **World Happiness Report Dataset (for classification)** and **Shop Customer Data (for clustering)**:

- This repository uses World Happiness Report Dataset from [Kaggle Website Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?resource=download&select=2016.csv). This dataset contains 13 columns to described the world happiness report based on several parameters for 157 rows. All columns are represented as below:
  - Country
  - Region
  - Happiness Rank
  - Happiness Score
  - Lower Confidence Interval
  - Upper Confidence Interval
  - Economy (GDP per Capita)
  - Family
  - Health (Life Expectancy)
  - Freedom
  - Trust (Government Corruption)
  - Generosity
  - Dystopia Residual
- This repository also uses Shop Customer Dataset from [Kaggle Website Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset). This dataset contains 8 columns to describe customer data who visits the shop with 2000 rows in total. All columns are represented as below:
  - CustomerID
  - Gender

## üìö Libraries Used in This Repository

- Numpy: library for multidimensional array and matrices processing.
- Pandas: library for data manipulation, reading data, and data analysis.
- Matplotlib: library for data plotting and data visualization.
- Seaborn: based on Matplotlib with more advanced features to visualize your data.
- Scikit-Learn: library for machine learning implementation, we use this library to show the difference between create machine learning from scratch approach and create machine learning using library approach.
